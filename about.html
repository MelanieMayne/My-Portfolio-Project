        <h2>Hello, I am Melanie Richardson</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Front-End Web Developer based in Long Beach, CA. I am
          originally from a small town in Kentucky, then I moved to New York
          City, and now I am in SoCal!</p> 
          <p>Web Development is a career
          change for me. I moved to New York City so that I could pursue my
          dream of being on Broadway, however, life had other plans for me.
          While working at some of my other jobs, I got to dabble in graphic
          design and coding a little and really enjoyed doing that and so I
          decided to give Front-End Web Development a try and I have thoroughly
          enjoyed my learning journey thus far.</p>
          <p>When I am not coding, you can
          find me binge-watching shows, cuddling with my cat, Mars, or relaxing
          on the beach with my significant other!</p>
          <p>I am taking coding workshops
          through SheCodes and I cannot wait until I have my full certification
          and can show the world what Melanie Richardson can do as a Front-End
          Web Developer!</p>
