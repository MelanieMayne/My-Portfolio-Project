            This is the most current project I have been working on through the SheCodes Responsive workshop. I built this fully responsive static website using HTML, CSS, VS Code, Bootstrap, Google Fonts, Font Awesome, GitHub, and Netlify.
          </p>
          <p>I have thoroughly enjoyed working on this project from designing all the details of the website such as the color palette, fonts, and layout to all the trial and errors of coding to get this website to look how I designed. </p>
          <p>For being relatively new to coding, I am super proud of myself with how this project turned out!</p>

            This project was definitely one of the harder and more rewarding projects I’ve done so far. It was the final project for the SheCodes Plus Workshop. I built this Weather Application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, VS Code, Bootstrap, Weather API, GitHub, and Netlify. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I designed this project myself, also. I definitely learned a lot working and re-working the JavaScript with the API so that I could get the app working exactly how it was supposed to. It was definitely frustrating, but even that much more rewarding once I finally got it working!

            This was my very first coding project I ever completed after only three short weeks of the SheCodes Basics Workshop. It is a static, non-responsive website built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            I designed this project, as well. Looking back on this project now and seeing how far I have come in just four more months of coding is quite surreal for me. I went from being able to design and code a basic website from the 90’s to coding a responsive and complex website fit for todays website standards.
